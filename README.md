# Google KickStart 2022
### What is KickStart?
<p> Kick Start offers coders around the world the chance to develop 
and hone their programming skills through online-hosted competition 
rounds. The three-hour rounds feature a variety of algorithmic challenges,
all developed by Google engineers so that you get a taste of the technical 
skills needed for a career at Google. The top competitors from our Kick Start
rounds may be invited to interview at Google. These rounds are held regularly 
throughout the year at different times so they are easily accessible to coders 
everywhere. Each Kick Start Round is open to all participants, no pre-qualification
is needed, so you can try your hand at one or give them all a shot. In addition
to our online rounds, Google is hosting several Coding Practice with Kick Start
sessions throughout the competition season. </p>
